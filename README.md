We implemented the same procedure and found an accuracy of 99.70% accuracy for MNIST digit recognition whereas the state of the art of MNIST dataset is 99.79%.<br>
We also found 99.79% accuracy for EMNIST digit recognition and 90.59% accuracy for EMNIST letter recognition which has 47 balanced letter classes. Which is an increased accuracy.
